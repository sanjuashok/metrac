this is a project meant to track my weight-loss and general fitness progress.

it's a command-line client that takes my current weight and height and updates
my firebase db with that info (plus some inferred info like my tdee, bmi, bmr).

TODO:
* fill out requirements.txt
* integrate with myfitnesspal
* command-line data-viz
* integrate periodic weight lifting stats
* integrate d3 visualization with sanju.io
* integrate media (photos/videos)

built using firebase and other things.
